Why I Made This Project

I created this calculator to practice Python basics like user input, loops, and error handling. The goal was to build a simple yet functional tool that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations while ensuring a smooth user experience.

How I Made It

The calculator runs in a continuous loop, letting users perform multiple calculations without restarting. It displays a menu with four operations: Addition, Subtraction, Division, and Multiplication, along with an option to exit. The program takes three numbers as input, validates them, and executes the selected operation.

To ensure error handling, I included checks for invalid inputs and division by zero, preventing the program from crashing. The outputs are formatted clearly for better readability.

What I Learned

This project helped me improve my understanding of loops, conditionals, input validation, and exception handling in Python.
